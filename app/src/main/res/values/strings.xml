<h1>Frequently Asked Questions(FAQ)</h1>
<p> <h2><b>1-¿What\'s the main goal of Trasposition Trainer?</b></h2>
 <p>Most music students and performers struggle with trasposing in real time and calculating a specific degree of any scale and root.
 This app was design to accelerate your dexterity on calcultating degrees and notes from the different tonalities and scales.</p>
 <p> After doing it for a while you\'ll start to feel much more comfortable playing due to your capability of understanding progressions in terms of degrees.
  That is the fastest and most efficient way of trasposing.</p></p>

<p><h2><b>2- ¿What can I practice with this app?</b></h2>
 You can practice either notes or chords of a particular or random key. To practice notes just enter \'Notes quiz\' on the main menu.
 If you want to practice chords pick \'Chord quiz\'.</p>

<p><h2><b>3-¿How do I start using the app according to my level?</b></h2>

The idea is to practice by stages:<br>

<h6>a)First stage:</h6> If you are totally new to trasposition you could start with the following set up:<br>


-Easy mode(the app will quiz you just about major scale)<br>
-Pick a specific key in the key dropdown list, like C, G or D for example<br>
-Set the answer time to 1 minute <br>
-If you are on chord mode pick the option with no 7ths. <br>


<h6>b)Second stage:</h6> Once you feel comfortable on the first stage, use the following set up:<br>


-Easy mode(the app will quiz you just about major scale) <br>
-Use the random option in the key dropdown list(the app will quiz you about any root) <br>
-Set the answer time to 1 minute <br>
-If you are on chord mode pick the option with no 7ths. <br>


<h6>c)Third stage:</h6> After spending some time with stage two is recommended to try to reduce the answer time. A set up according to this stage could be like this:<br>


-Easy mode(the app will quiz you just about major scale)<br>
-Use the random option in the key dropdown list(the app will quiz you about any root)<br>
-Set the answer time to 20 or 30 seconds.<br>
-If you are on chord mode pick the option with 7ths(if you use this option consider increasing answering time to 1 minute to get used to 7ths).<br>


<h6>d)Fourth stage:</h6> You are ready to practice with Natural Minor scale. Just follow the same steps of difficulty that you did with major scale.
Start with a specific key. Then pick random mode and set the difficulty level to medium to be quizzed  about major AND natural minor scale chords and notes.
Play with different answer times to improve more and more your dexterity on trasposition.<br>

<h6>e)Fifth stage:</h6> Finally, practice with the Harmonic Minor and Melodic Minor scale. Do the same as in stage four.
Practice each scale individually and then use Random mode and Hard mode to be quizzed about notes/chords on random roots on either Major Scale, Natural Minor Scale,
Harmonic Minor Scale and Melodic Minor Scale.</p>

<p> <h2><b>4-¿How long will it take me to get better at thinking in degrees instead of chords and use that ability to traspose in real time using just my brain?</b></h2>

 If you follow the suggested practice programm you will notice great improvement in the first month. After months of doing it you will be really good
 in a real situation at knowing what\'s going on with the chords in real time.</p>


 <p><h2><b> 5-¿Need further assistance?</b></h2>
